# MyDrive
Developed a full-stack SaaS application inspired by Google Drive using Next.js 15 (App Router), React Query, and Hono.js for seamless file storage and sharing.

Built dynamic dashboard UI with Tailwind CSS, implementing custom components (buttons, sidebar, breadcrumb navigation) for intuitive UX.

Enabled secure file uploads with structured metadata handling using custom API routes and Hono.js middleware to manage body size limits.

Integrated React Query for efficient mutation handling, caching, and real-time data synchronization across the application.

Implemented file sharing logic with role-based permissions, using React Hook Form and validation for user input and access control.

Addressed performance bottlenecks by optimizing lazy loading states, using useEffect and dynamic loaders for smoother UX.

Configured environment-aware API endpoints (production/sandbox) for scalable backend interactions and robust subscription management.

Deployed the app with full CI/CD pipeline, ensuring a production-ready, performant SaaS platform clone.
